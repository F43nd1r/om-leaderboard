# Explanation of Table

## Displayed Scores

Each puzzle has up to 12 entries in the table, 4 primary metrics and 3 tiebreakers each.

The primary metrics are cost, cycles, area (free space puzzles) / instructions (production puzzles), and the sum of all 3.  Scores will only be displayed in the table if they beat or match the record in a primary metric.

Tiebreakers for minimum cost are lowest cycles, lowest area, and lowest product cycles*area.  Tiebreakers for cycles and area are the same with metrics permuted, and production puzzles replace area with instructions.  An asterisk denotes the product tiebreaker.

Tiebreakers for the sum are cost, cycles, and area individually.

If a solution holds multiple tiebreakers, it will only be displayed once per primary metric.

On 24 March 2018, /u/12345ieee helped tremendously with revamping the update bot. It now includes gifs when they are linked in the comment, and the puzzle name is a fake link containing the current pareto frontier (mouse over to see frontier scores).

Tournament Puzzles for [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/opus_magnum/comments/abpxj8/opus_magnum_tourney/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/opus_magnum/comments/eohzw1/opus_magnum_tournament_2020/) and [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/opus_magnum/comments/klvf0k/opus_magnum_tournament_2021/) are included in this leaderboard. You can find these puzzles in this [master collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2597159271) on steam.

## Looping vs nonlooping, waste chain vs clean, etc.

A solution need only bring up the completion screen to count.

## Attribution

This is not intended to be a competitive leaderboard, but rather an informative one.  The community as a whole can help improve the known bests.  People shouldn't worry about sharing their solutions for fear someone else snipes a piece off the tiebreaker.  As such, scores are not attributed.

# Alternate leaderboard sites

Since November 2021 the improved leaderboard site by F43nd1r is available at https://zlbb.faendir.com. You can browse records by category (including many more community categories) or puzzle. It also includes a view and a visualizer for pareto frontier.

jinyou, a player with many contributions to this leaderboard but no access to post to reddit from his country, has created a second site with a backup leaderboard.  The gifs on this second site are hosted in a manner which may for some users be more responsive than web.opendrive where his solutions are uploaded for linking here.
