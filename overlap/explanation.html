<h1>Overlap Leaderboard</h1>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>The rules of the game would imply that</p>
<ul>
    <li>components (inputs, outputs, glyphs, arms) cannot overlap with one another</li>
    <li>Disposal glyph and Van Berlo's wheel can only appear once in a solution</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these two restrictions are not enforced by the solution file,<br>
    and solutions which violate them can still be run and recorded in game.</p>
<p>Solutions with this behavior can be created using an external editor,<br>
    or you can rotate an object, drag it off screen,<br>
    shift click another object, and drag it in place,<br>
    to achieve overlap within the game itself as shown in this video:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>There is no known mechanism to double the disposal glyph or<br>
    Van Berlo's wheel within the game,<br>
    so this requires an external editor such as <a href="https://om.faendir.com/">F43dit</a> or <a href="http://fazzone.github.io/opus/">Fazzone</a>.
</p>
<p>When running solutions with this exploit,<br>
    it is <b>highly encouraged to enable Hermit Mode</b> in the options,<br>
    so as not to overwrite your existing scores.</p>
