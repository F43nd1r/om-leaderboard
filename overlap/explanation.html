<h1>Overlap Leaderboard</h1>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>The rules of the game would imply that</p>
<ul>
    <li>components (inputs, outputs, glyphs, arms) cannot overlap with one another</li>
    <li>Disposal glyph and Van Berlo's wheel can only appear once in a solution</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these two restrictions are not enforced by the solution file, and solutions which violate them can still be run and recorded in game.</p>
<p>Solutions with this behavior can be created using an external editor, or you can rotate an object, drag it off screen, shift click another object, and drag it in place, to achieve overlap within the game itself as shown in this video:</p>

<p>When running solutions with this exploit, it is <b>highly encouraged to enable Hermit Mode</b> in the options, so as not to overwrite your existing scores.</p>
